# MAL-UWP
School assignment to make an UWP app. As true multitaskers, we're handing it in for two classes
This is meant to be an application to view information about Anime, Manga and stuff related to that.

We use the Jikan API to make this happen with info from MAL. If either MAL or Jikan does go
offline, the original plan was to use Kitsu. However, due to time constraints, we decided they'd
better just stay online for our demo and afterwards, we will proceed to ignore this project.

All of this was the work of two people in a single weekend and a few availlable hours in the
days around that weekend. It was glorious and I hope this project will rest in peace after
Monday 12:00PM (that's right, the deadline is at noon).
